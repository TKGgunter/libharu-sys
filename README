Note on Compilation:
+This binding of the libharu library compiles without cmake 
or any other build tools outside of the rustc and cargo.
And as of version 0.0.1 does not construct configuration header file, hpdf_config.h, during builds. The current configuration file excludes pnglib and zlib as dependances.  If you wish embed pngs I would recommend the Image library and pass raw bytes of your png image plane to libharu.  In addition I have not tested the routines that require pnglib or zlib.
